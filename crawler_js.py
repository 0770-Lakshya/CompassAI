 crawler_js.py — crawler for JavaScript-rendered sites (the Playwright variant)
===============================================================================

Same output as crawler.py (pages/<netloc>/*.html + index.json) but runs a
real headless browser so client-side nav, dropdowns, and hydrated links
are visible. Use this for React/Next/Vue sites; use crawler.py for plain
server-rendered sites (it's faster).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 WHY A WHOLE SECOND CRAWLER EXISTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`requests` downloads the HTML the server sends and stops there. For a classic
website that is the finished page. For a React / Next.js / Vue app it is not —
what arrives over the wire is roughly:

    <body>
      <div id="root"></div>
      <script src="/bundle.js"></script>
    </body>

Every word of visible content is created LATER, by JavaScript, in the browser.
`requests` cannot run JavaScript, so crawler.py sees an empty page and produces
zero chunks. This is the single most common reason a site "fails to index".

Playwright solves it by driving a real Chromium: it loads the page, executes the
bundle, waits for React to render ("hydration"), and only then do we read the
DOM. We get the same HTML a human would see.

      CSR vs SSR ........... https://web.dev/articles/rendering-on-the-web

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 WHY THIS CANNOT RUN ON THE SERVER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A headless Chromium is roughly 300MB on disk and hundreds of MB of RAM in use.
Render's free tier gives the whole API 512MB. So this file runs on YOUR machine,
via register_site.py, and only the finished chunks.json is uploaded. The server
never launches a browser. That constraint is why the project has three separate
ingestion paths at all.

Usage:
    pip install playwright
    playwright install chromium     # downloads the actual browser binary, once
    python crawler_js.py https://openlake.in/

            # ==============================================================
            # PROBLEM: modern navigation menus do not put their links in the DOM
            # until you interact with them. A "Projects ▾" dropdown containing
            # links to six sub-pages renders those <a> tags only on hover or
            # click. So even a fully hydrated page can be HIDING most of the
            # site's structure, and a naive crawler silently misses whole
            # sections without ever erroring.
            #
            # SOLUTION: after the page settles, find everything that looks like
            # a menu trigger and hover each one. Whatever it reveals gets
            # rendered into the DOM, and since we read page.content() afterwards,
            # those links are captured and queued like any other.
            #
            # (check_links.py is the tool that surfaced this problem: it diffs
